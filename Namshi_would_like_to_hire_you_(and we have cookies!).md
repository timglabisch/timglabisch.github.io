  
## Namshi would like to hire you (and we have cookies!)


Hi Tim,  

Sorry for contacting you with this "strange" way, but I couldn't find your email anywhere :P

I’m Alessandro Cinelli (aka cirpo), backend lead developer at [Namshi.com](https://en-ae.namshi.com), an e-commerce startup based in Dubai.

I want to **bold** that I’m not a recruiter; I’m a developer like you, and that’s my passion.

I’m contacting you because I saw your Github and twitter profile, based on that I think you could be a great addition to our backend/api team.

Here at Namshi we are using several tools, programming languages and paradigm to boost our architecture:

* last year we shifted from a monolitic to an SOA architecture 
* we are using PHP5.5+, Symfony, Silex, Node.js, Angular.js, Express.js, Flask, Python (even Ruby for some system scripts) and more
on the data layer: Redis, MySQL, Solr (soon are moving to ElasticSearch)
* Github, Travis-ci, Vagrant and Docker for development 
* Docker is also used for internal applications, soon it will be use in production

We are still looking for developers that loves to build high quality and tested software: someone who is not worried to get his hands dirty 
and hack with the latest technologies to deliver well designed and simple solutions.

At Namshi we strongly believe in opensource and sharing, other than pushing quality everyday: you can find more information on who we are and 
what we do on our [tech blog](http://tech.namshi.com/join-us) and [github account](http://github.com/namshi):

You can also find some presentations that our VP of Technologies [Alex](http://www.slideshare.net/odino) and [me](http://www.slideshare.net/cirpo) gave at international conferences and that are related to what we are doing here at Namshi:

Would you be interested in joining us? 
Let’s have a chat on hangout or skype (nickname cirpolo)

cheers
